    My Algorithmic logic to solving Sudoku
    
    Step 1.
        Pick and empty square 
        
    Step 2.
        Try all numbers
        
    Step 3.
        Find one that works
        
    Step4.
        Repeat until dead end
        
    Step 5.
        Backtrack 
        (go back to last sucessful location and try to advance
        with a different number, if no numbers advance to end
        go back further)
